# Check Yo' Self!

  This is a to-do list app that allows users to create checklists for anything! The catch is that the user must checkoff every task before deleting the card. This makes it so the user cant make it seem like they have nothing to do. The user can also filter their to-do lists by urgency, which allows them to target their most important tasks.

 * open your terminal and initialize git
 * use the git clone command followed by the copied ssh key
